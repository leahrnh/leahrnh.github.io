Step one in any project is assembling your data. I'm going to use a dataset that's been on my mind for a while: my personal chat data stretching back over the years. Although this is a relatively small dataset as ML goes, I'm optimistic that it will be large enough to draw some interesting insights from. For obvious reasons I will not be making the data itself public, but I will share how I assemble it. If you happen to follow along with your own chat data, I would love to see what you put together!

Apple messages
-------------
iMessage data is easy to find on a Mac, and conveniently already in a database. It can be found under `/Users/$USER/Library/Messages/chat.db`.

I also have a bunch of iChat files from 2008-2014 that I saved. I vaguely remember downloading them before I switched computers years ago. I even left myself a README file - thanks past Leah! These are saved as Apple Binary Property List files, which can easily be converted to XML form. I wrote myself a little bash script to convert them all:

```
for dir in *; do for file in ${dir}/*.ichat; do plutil -convert xml1 "${file}"; done; done
```

Google messages
--------------
Gchat, and later Google Hangouts, was my primary chat system for years, starting around 2006 when it was Very Cool. Google makes it pretty easy to download your chat history, using [Google Takeout](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout). I went through and unchecked everything except "Hangouts" (for chats going back to 2013), and "Mail" for earlier chats. (I clicked "All Mail data included" and unchecked everything except "Chat".)

The Hangouts data comes in one massive json file with 4,071,020 lines and 107,602 messages. The Mail chats come in mbox format, which is actually plain text. It has 1,608,522 and I believe 118,764 messages. There are fewer files from 2008 (peak gChat) than from 2018, so I suspect stuff is missing and there's a lot of overlap with Hangouts, but I'll take what I can get.


Signal
------
Recently my favorite messaging system is [Signal](https://signal.org/). I found my Signal chat data in a database under `/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/Signal/databases`.

AIM
---
lol no

As someone with heart of an archivist and an apparent fondess for awkward memories, one of my regrets in life is that I didn't save my extensive AIM chat history circa 2004-2008. However, starting in 2008 I was using AIM through iChat, so fortunately or unfortunately all is not lost.

For some reason though I did save a few AIM chats from 2007 or so, fonts, colors, and all. Here's a little glimpse!
