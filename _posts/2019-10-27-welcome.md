In my job as a machine learning scientist, I spend a lot of time working with big systems over a large amount of time by countless people. It's easy to get sucked into tiny parts of a system and lose site of the whole. My plan for this blog is to put together a one-person sized project where I an really dive into the different tools and and techniques. I hope to try out some new languages (R, SQL), learn more about creating charts and diagrams, and play around with different machine learning packages.
